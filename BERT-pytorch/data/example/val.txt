There were ten in a bed|And the little one said|Roll over, roll over|So they all rolled over|And one fell out
The wheels on the bus go round and round|Round and round, Round and round|The wheels on the bus go round and round|All through the town
This old man, he played one|He played knick-knack on my thumb|Knick-knack paddy whack|Give the dog the bone|This old man came rolling home
Twinkle, twinkle, little star|How I wonder what you are|Up above the world so high|Like a diamond in the sky
